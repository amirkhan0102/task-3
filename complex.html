 <pre class="id" >   The following list contains common time complexits of algorithms:

    O(1)The running time of a <b>const-time </b>algorithm does not depend on the input size.
       A typical constant-time  algorithm is a direct formula that calculates the answer.

    O(logn) A <b>logarithmic</b>algorithm often halves the input size at each step.The running time of such an algorithm 
       is lagoritmic, because<i> log<sub>2</sup>n </i>equals the number of times <i>n</i>must be dived by 2
        to get 1.

    O(n) A <b>square root algorithm</b> is slower than O(<i>logn</i>)but faster than O(n).A special property of
        square roots is taht -/n=n/-/n,so the square root -/n lies in some sense in the middle of the input.

    O(n) <b>liner</b>algorithm goes through the input a constan number of times. This is often the best possible 
       time complexity because it is usually necessary to acces each input element at least once before reporting the 
       answer

    O(nlogn) This time complexity often indicates that the algorithm sorts the input because the time complexity of 
       efficienty sorting algorithms is (O)(nlogn).Another possiblity is that the algorithm uses a data structure
       where each operation takes O(logn)time.

    O(n<sup>2</sup>) A<b>quadratic</b>algorithm often contains two nested loops. It is possible to go through all pairs of the 
       input elements in O(n<sup>2</sup>) time. 
       
       O(n<sup>3</sup>) A<b>cubic</b>algorithm often contains two nested loops. It is possible to go through all pairs of the 
       input elements in O(n<sup>3</sup>) time.
       
    O(2<sup>n</sup>) This time complexity often indecatis that the algorithm iteraes through all subsets of the input elements.
       For example,the subsets of {1,2,3}are {1},{2},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3}and{1,2,3}
